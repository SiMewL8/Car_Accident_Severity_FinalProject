Due to bad road conditions, their car skidded across the freeway, onto the center divider. As a result, our member was hospitalized.Their story inspired us to use a dataset to analyze and predict the chances of getting in an accident based on specific criteria and data.We see great potential in utilizing this dataset to provide interesting insights and research.Programs ETL: Python, Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQLVisualizations and Dashboard: JavaScript, CSS, HTMLForecasting and Analysis: Supervised Machine LearningObjectives By entering certain criteria such as zip codes, seasonal trends, severity, and traffic attributes, one can better forecast the chances of getting into a car accident. It is a simple and easy tool that any driver can use.
