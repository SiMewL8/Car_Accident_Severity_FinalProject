            <h2>accidentsHappen</h2>
              <p>A car accident story inspired us to use a dataset to analyze and predict the chances of getting in an accident based on
                  specific criteria and data. We see great potential in utilizing this dataset to provide interesting insights and research.
                  By entering certain criteria such as zip codes, seasonal trends, severity, and traffic attributes, one can better forecast the
                  chances of getting into a car accident. It is a simple and easy tool that any driver can use.

              <p>By creating a simple cartesian chart based on latitude and longitude, a map similar to the map of the US can be visually represented
                 by each accident occurred in each zip code. Furthermore, by color filtering from States, we can overlay a map of all the different states in the US.

                Here we are presented with Top10 Zip Codes that had the most accidents. It would have been a better choice to include city names.

              <p>Throughout the four years, we were hoping to find certain trends but then the months of one year. Thus, we can see there are certain trends,
                 especially during the summer, that might lead to higher accident rates.</p>

            <img src="static/images/weekday_counts.png">
              <p>Based on the assumption that a normal work week is Monday to Friday and weekend is Saturday to Sunday, we can surmise that a higher percentage
                 of accidents occur within the weekday, even though there are five days in a week day and only two days on a weekend.

              <p>We wanted to group the time in parts of the day since we can accurately dig insights onto which parts of the days have more data. we came up with time slots
                  that are divided in such way: <br><br>
                  Early Morning (3 am to 6:59 am)<br>
                  Morning (7 am to 10:59 am),<br>
                  Afternoon (11 am to 2:59 pm),<br>
                  Late Afternoon (3 pm to 6:59 pm),<br>
                  Night (7 pm to 10:59 pm),<br>
                  Late Night (11 pm to 2:59 am)<br><br><br><br>

                <p>We are planning on adding interactivity within the next deliverable. Stay tuned! </p>
